Technically, we live the entire database ecosystem wherever it resides, from architecture to infrastructure to low level connector.

Furthermore we value your opinions, insights and questions and encourage you to share them both in anonymous surveys or within the direct discussions.\n\nBy the end of your co-op term, you'll be able to do things such as: coding and testing parts of a feature; configuring environments and setting up test automation and frameworks; authoring both developer and end user documentation; provided with guidance in gaining domain knowledge in the constantly expanding world of database ecosystem and cloud, and in how we solve unique problems using a variety of technologies for industry leading (and some unicorn) clients.\n\nAs a Software Developer you'll be mentored in being able to:\nThe following describes some (but not all) of the activities you will do within the role:\n\nTake on development, testing or documentation tasks for your team with guidance.\nPerform code reviews and learn new techniques from the exercise.\nParticipate in design discussions and pick up new concepts as part of this.\nFollow all of Improving Vancouver's software development processes even though many may be new to you.\nComfortably identify most positive test cases and benefit from guidance for negative and more complex test cases.\nParticipate in your team's Agile ceremonies:\nRaising blockers in stand-up\nRaising improvement suggestions in retrospective\nBeing assigned tasks from the sprint board\nParticipate in planning poker during Sprint Planning and asking questions to ensure you understand the scope of each ticket.\nFeel empowered to ask your Team Lead, Development Manager, your team mates, cross company specialists or any other employess for assistance\nHelp a team member needing help, even if you may need guidance.\nPresent the work you and your team does across the company or with a client.\nParticipate in building relationships with others outside of your team through multiple social programs.\nCapture new learning in a confluence page or enhance an existing one to capture or update your learnings.\nHave meaningful 1:1 meetings with your Team Lead and/or Development Manager, building relationships by getting to know them personally.
