Fusion will deliver clean, safe, and on-demand power at industrial scale, providing a powerful complement to renewables and a pathway to a zero-emission grid.\n\nCombining new technologies, proven industrial processes, and advances in fundamental fusion science, General Fusion aims to be the first in the world to develop commercial fusion power. Key performance requirements have been demonstrated at the system level, setting the stage for building a pre-commercial fusion power prototype.\n\nStart: May 2025\nTerm: 4, 8, 12 or 16 month placements available.\n\nKey Responsibilities:\nIn this position you will participate in the development of the pulsed power supply for the plasma injector for General Fusion's plasma testing. You will gain experience with high-voltage pulsed-power systems and plasma physics. You will also gain experience with shop tools, heavy lifting equipment, electrical and plasma diagnostic equipment. It's all part of building a world-changing fusion reactor. Typical tasks will include electrical and mechanical design and assembly, fabricating and installing new fixtures and equipment, testing components, and analyzing experimental and test data. No prior experience in plasma physics is necessary, but broad mechanical and electrical aptitude is required.\n\nApplicants with a range of practical vs theoretical and mechanical vs electrical aptitude are encouraged."
