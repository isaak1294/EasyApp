      "value": "Discover TRIUMF, Canada's particle accelerator centre, and one of the world's leading laboratories for particle and nuclear physics and accelerator-based science. TRIUMF's diverse community of nearly 600 multidisciplinary researchers, engineers, technicians, tradespeople, staff, and students create a unique incubator for Canadian excellence, as well as a portal to premier global collaborations. Fueling innovation and improving lives, we are committed to accelerating discovery and shaping a better world.\n\nEquity, diversity, and inclusion are integral to excellence and enhance our ability to create knowledge and opportunity for all. Together, we are committed to building an inclusive culture that encourages, supports, and celebrates the voices of our employees, students, partners, and the people and communities we serve.\n\nTRIUMF's student program typically hires ~40 students each term from across all disciplines who hang together socially and professionally during the term, and beyond. Our program offers young minds a chance to gather, learn, make new friends, and have fun doing so during their time at TRIUMF. We hold weekly ProD sessions for students which include different activities such as conflict resolution, emotional intelligence, critical thinking, and active listening. Additionally, we hold weekly seminars about the different experiments at TRIUMF, and these talks specifically cater to students. Located on the UBC campus makes it easier for students to make friends, create memories, and explore Vancouver all while working at TRIUMF.\n\nTRIUMF's student program is more than just a place to work, its learning, memories, friendships, exploration, and development all clubbed into one.\n\nCome join us to see how we are working to unlock the mysteries of the universe and shape the future. Apply now and be part of our extraordinary journey.\n\nLearn more about the amazing research and work we do at TRIUMF.\n\nhttps://www.discoverourlab.triumf.ca\n\nhttp://www.rarestdrug.com\n\nBasic Function:\n\nLiquid Xenon detectors are planned to be used in a range of new experiments. Two examples in which TRIUMF researchers are involved are the nEXO and PIONEER experiments. nEXO aims at uncovering the nature of the neutrino through the first detection of neutrinoless double beta decay that would show that neutrinos are their own anti-particle. PIONEER, a recently approved experiment, will be searching for new physics in pion decays.\n\nThe performance of the detectors foreseen for these experiments depend on the purity of the xenon.\n\n\nThe student will analyze the data collected by a purity monitor recently built at TRIUMF and installed in a 2L liquid xenon cryostat located at McGill. The student will also participate to upgrades and local tests at TRIUMF of a calibration system for the monitor.\n\nResponsibilities:\n\nThe student will be able to participate in all aspects of the work mentioned above. A significant component of the project will be on analysis and hands-on work for upgrade and tests. If the student is interested they will also be able to work on optical simulations."
