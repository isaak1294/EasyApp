      "value": "Experimental Plasma Physics Data Analysis Co-op Posting\n\nGeneral Fusion is transforming how the world is energized by developing the first commercially-viable fusion power plant. Fusion will deliver clean, safe and on-demand power at industrial scale, providing a powerful complement to renewables and a pathway to a zero-emission grid.\n\nCombining new technologies, proven industrial processes, and advances in fundamental fusion science, General Fusion aims to be the first in the world to develop commercial fusion power. Key performance requirements have been demonstrated at the system level, setting the stage for building a pre-commercial fusion power prototype.\n\nJob Title: Experimental Plasma Physics Co-op\nLocation: Richmond BC, Canada\n\nStart: May 2025\nTerm: 4, 8, 12 or 16 month placements available.\n\nKey Responsibilities:\nIn this position you will participate in the development of a magnetized plasma experiment in support of General Fusion's magnetized target fusion concept. You will gain experience analyzing the dynamics of high temperature magnetized plasmas and help guide optimization of plasma injector performance by uncovering empirical trends in experimental data. You will gain experience with the measurement of plasma properties using data from magnetic probes, visible light spectroscopy, infrared interferometry, laser scattering, and x-ray diagnostics.\n\nTypical tasks will include using existing code and software tools to examine and find trends in a large set of existing plasma data as well as writing new code to analyze experimental data in new ways. No prior experience in plasma physics is necessary, but broad mathematical problem-solving skills, basic physics understanding, and computer programming experience are required."
